# Motivation

- Raising interest in the middle-income trap

  - 3860 returns in Google Scholar (as of June 17th, 2018)

--
  
# Objectives

- Investigate the _potential connection_ of two literatures:

  1. The middle-income trap hypothesis
  
  2. The premature deindustrialization hypothesis 

- Apply this _potential connection_ to the context of Asia

# Data and Methods

- Sample of 27 countries for the period of 1970- 2014

## For the middle income trap:

- Compare the growth rates of the World Bank's income groups:
  
  - MIC growth < LIC growth
  
  - MIC growth < HIC growth

## For the premature deindustrialization hypothesis:

- Pooled cross-section regressions:

  - $Industrialization = f(+GDP, -GDP^2, Controls)$

---

# Results

## For the middle income trap:
  
  - MIC growth > LIC growth
  
  - MIC growth > HIC growth

--

## For the premature deindustrialization hypothesis:

  - $Industrialization = f(+GDP, -GDP^2, (?)Controls)$
  
  - The peak of the inverted-U has declined (only for employment)
  
  - The turning point has declined (for both employment and output)
  
  - More notorious for South Asia
 
--
  
**Implication/warning:**

- Premature deindustrialization in Asia may decrease the growth rates of middle-income countries
